copied from phone:

songs get longer as deeper areas are explored.
ex. 59s loops at homestem, full / long ambience at "gardens" or dead ends
ex. subareas are same tune played at 70%

homestem connects to all worlds.
keep filestucture /ezic/homestem?
i want to rename project. something crypic or meaningless?
something meaningful but not apparent? acryonyms dont work well.
perhaps /homestem/[room] is more appropriate?
perhaps a subdomain is more appropriate? unsure how filesystem works in this case. would possibly require a real host? does github limit you? can github use subdomains?
ex. homestem.flootah.dev/[room]

will i focus storytelling on being nonverbal?
yume nikki focuses on atmosphere. poetry and puzzles require author/audience communition which can remove atmosphere.
tough call.

should user/password prompts be included? should they give hints? a la notpr0n
ex. deeper areas, new areas, vulnerable topics..
this implies that puzzles will be a part of the project.
also implies puzzle hints n3ed be included, implying verbal communication between author and audience

i have decided that in in order to keep interest while exploring,
there must be something for the dreamer to "collect".
humans enjoy hoarding, after all.

therefore, what dreamers will be hoarding is information.
information that allows them to dig deeper into the well.
what they will also hoard is memories. dead ends must /mean/ something.
they have to look beautiful. tell a story. be vulnerable.
ideally, the way there will hint at it, too. make it make sense.

it's probably important to lay out this formula as a microcasm in homestem.
what is that, though?
 > explore the "level"
 > solve a puzzle within
 > discover a garden, with cryptic meanings, stories, and whatnot.
 >> hopefully, these tie together with the theme of the level.
 * sidenote: what's a better name than "level"? i want something cuter like garden.
 ** ooh, maybe "stem?" would make homestem feel a bit literal, but.. i kinda like it
