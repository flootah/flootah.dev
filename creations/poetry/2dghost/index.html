        <p style="text-align: center;">
i wanna be a 2-d ghost in your dream
feelings of solitude, and love, and esteem
small chance that you're the one, or i'm the only
i'll throw my life away, just so i can see
            
you'll be my universe, ill be the shadow
dance to the melody, of your piano
the dice lands on desk, and i surrender
i threw my life away, and got my answer</p>
