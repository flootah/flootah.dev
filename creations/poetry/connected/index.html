in every word they both sent, was you
as close as we could ever get to true
toss in a coin and we would hear it;
something to find that kindred spirit

inside, there's a very odd window
we would hold it apart, with all of my heart
with all our real words. the most difficult parts
something worth having if it meant we could start

in time, the glass has found itself broken
somehow a lie was the last real thing spoken
now they all get to talk to me
someone that never learned what they could be

sorry.</p>
