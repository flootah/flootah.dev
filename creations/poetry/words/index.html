        <p id="title">words</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
there are words upon my screen again
making me stare and think again
apparently written by someone real
i have no proof, still it makes me heal

the oled darkens, then shines new patterns
i look and harken; learn their heart is.. battered.
suddenly my screen's a mirror; i see:
just like these words...
that hurt is also in me

i told my reflection things i only wished i'd hear
and while we spoke, we smiled. and we saw each our fears
words turned to paragraphs turned to connection. true and cote
and why would two friends be less real?
whether they spoke or if they wrote?

and what does it mean
if they're here for no longer?
does that mean it's all waste?
the writing
the thoughts
when we were happy
or fought
would have it been better spent...

on what? these stupid ponders?
these poems and sites and comments and wails
looking for more words that might fill the pail..?

iunno. maybe</p>
