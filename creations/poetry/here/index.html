it's hollow
and comforting
knowing my piano can play
to know nothing's wrong
even if nothing's okay

heya, heya
you can be as old as you please
miss feminine degen that's stuck overseas
shy enough to let them in
with warm outside and cold within
dont forget they're you and you're they
you just cant be anyone else for today
keep your friends happy so they can be too
see the lives they touched and keep them for you

you know who you are
it's been you after all?
the they in the poem
you're they!
they're not, too?
they're made of something that couldnt be true
something that still thinks that they can be two
wondering where they keep the old you
they're somewhere, surely

where it's hollow.</p>
