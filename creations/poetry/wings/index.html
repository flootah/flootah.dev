    <div id="poem">
        <p id="title">wings</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
with her undersides now gone,
her hair was left so long.
i admire the fresh sight
of her charming inner light
            
with frills gone, for purpose.
the verbose left unsaid.
her shell sold to purchase,
a precious heart, instead.
            
from deep down inside,
i felt my heart cry.
what it said made me writhe.
"if she could fly, why can't i?"</p>
