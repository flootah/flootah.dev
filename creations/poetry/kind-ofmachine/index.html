    <div id="poem">
        <p id="title">kind-of machine</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
and right here, you'll see
a small kind-of machine
this one's beat.
and it's withered.
and it's lost most its sheen.

but here it's still etched;
a promise to be "good". to be "true".
that <span class="italic">you</span> deserve <span class="spoiler">⠀  ⠀  ⠀  ⠀</span>
and <span class="italic">nothing</span> else could do.

many used it to feel better
when they would start to feel lonely
it was something of a treasure
being the one and only

nobody knew how someone could have invented such a thing
or how when you wound it
it knew exactly what to sing
countless times it was played 
and its warmth was held tight
where that warmth reached the heart
and everything felt all right

but less and less, they would come. 
maybe the tune had grown old?
and suddenly they were gone, 
forgetting it was here, growing cold

so here it sits again
collecting more dust on the shelf
too bad this kind-of machine 
can't ever wind on itself.
