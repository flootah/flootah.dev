person.
twenty four, boring, and mired
tired cadence and rarely inspired
barely covered in patience and dust
plugged into software that isn't robust

the art [twittter.com] that they save keeps darkness deprived
and their music [last.fm] was playing to keep them sincere
over tapes that remind them of things they held dear
you could probably find their steam profile, here.</p>
