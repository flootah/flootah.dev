hold your head while nothing spills out
speak your mind 'till there's atoms of doubt
dialogue drought cues the sink in the heart
without the sound the bout drives them apart
what kindess of art could ever fix 'em?
whose words do they say?
should they stir or mix 'em?
not today. they aren't feeling so hot
better tell 'em they're not.
put their heart on the spot.
say they're made of soot, grease, pity, and coward-ice
too nice to think and too sorry to say 'please' twice
useless *hugs*.
worthless degrees.
cureless disease</p>
