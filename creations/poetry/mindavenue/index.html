        <p style="text-align: center;">
for everything that i can't say.
and why i viewed you oddly.
a borrowed peace that can't be paid.
wont let me say im sorry.

throw it to another time.
everything that can hurt me.
now, why am i so hard to find?
when did my soul turn empty?

already closed the coward's escape.
i'll never leave my fortress.
would i ever change my shape?
dream more of algor mortis.</p>
