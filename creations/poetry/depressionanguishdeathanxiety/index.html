i can understand what God is supposed to be for
come up with a plan, then another will come before me
yet i don't get the messages, they don't arrive at my door
so how do i forget when happiness ignores me
in time..
The Fates will always come to make the steal

so stand on all the f’Ωcks who tend to look away from
things that bring to light what they could still become
bless them with your insight: all things are above them
make sure they know; nothing will ever love them
and think...
isn't there something here with an appeal?

now i have it in my bones.
i've been stealing.
that's this feeling?
and it's not what i've been owed.
that's what i am?
forever damned?
perpetual purgatory "happiness" hoarder?
drops an end to all this disorder
is it
too much to ask for permission to heal?

it only takes a bit to fear forevermore
to relegate your life to never be explored
it only takes a moment to succumb to life's abrasion
to let the disgust become your new foundation
it only takes a second to grow your own belief
that nothing else exists but hell, pain, death, and grief
it only takes an instant to build the paradigm
if you hold onto your heart, you can build a paradise
in-side.
don't you remember how that used to feel?</p>
