there was once a time i was so close to content
as close as it gets to knowing what it meant
when speaking could never make you misunderstood
and weathering the storm would somehow feel good

suddenly in freefall before your mind could tell you
welcome to your new loop! hope you've nowhere to get to!
cause it's slow
and sinks in every inch of your flesh
and each thought is a mine that makes it all fresh
do your best! and maybe you won't be so hurt
throw your heart farther and shiver
while we do our worst.

the farther i was, the less light reached my soul
i wonder if this is what they mean by the hole
how long do i stare at the darkness in it's place?
how long do i endure 
if it wears love for a face?</p>
