what are you afraid of when you look in the dark?
i worry that i'm projective of all its worst parts.
that i paint myself martyr to sell my good grace
then shred it in secret so no one sees a trace
but i'm just a troubled artist√©!
a classic case of pitiful kindness!
"oh, forgive them for their smallish crimes"
"they're trying!! and wouldn't fail this time..."
abuse and thievery of tremendous goodwill
and faced with anything, i'd only sit still
i stare and see hurt thrown, and while my heart drops
i pretend that it's something that couldn't be stopped
i'm yellow and i'm blue and im black and im dead
the lowly worm that was better off dead
that's what i worry.
