        <p style="text-align: center;">
just don't wanna be a lost cause
but how? when i hate who i was
never made the time for what i had to do
never did what made me happy, too
built myself a shelter made of sticks and mush
now life's storm has passed and my soul is crushed
right where i belong, under my home's fallen weight
paying for the sins, walking into death's gate
a voice tugs me back, pleading into me a thought
said a couple things of what i had once sought.
you're the one who writes your own damn story
good cards aren't who create a man of glory
don't depend on everything that makes you warm
be your own home, and you take on life's storm
set your sail, and look across your sea
bloom into who you were meant to be</p>
