bleh. not caring makes everyone around me upset.
i ignore the gift human connection.
isn't that selfish?
im most content alone. but im not sure if it's worth it.
            
i have been making efforts to talk to new people. it's more than before, but still not much.
i have met some people i feel good about. conversations that felt "genuine" to me. its nice.
but after a while, the same worries i have about other conversations plague me.
i feel unequipped to handle spending time with others, even on the rare occasions i enjoy it.</p>
