write just one more verse
one that might say what you might feel
fight, and swear, and curse
that someone might be at your heel

read and smile and think of love
forget what there was inklings of
how would you ever be hurt again?
no one could do their worst again..

throw them in the ebb and flow
tell them that you just don't know
burn in that sorry hole of ever-sore pity
none of your rhymes make you any more witty

hope for the aches to go away
whine for them, so they don't stay
do nothing to make them understand
never change to help yourself.
