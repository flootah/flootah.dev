everything i spill; ugly, old, and rotten
only ever real to the me who has forgotten
isn't there a hill for a poison like me?
the place where people have no right to be.

only nine more days 'till the last one's here
about time they gave us a little more fear
and it's just what you've been hoping for, dear
sore bones and rotten hearts to cherish all year
y'all hear? they softened the walls for me to crawl on
i can nest in her lungs, curl up, and bawl on.

remember when time had meaning to you?
everyone mattered cause their words were new
when somebody told you, "it couldn't be true"
and you believed them
and you held them, too.








haven't you ever thought that was silly of you?</p>
