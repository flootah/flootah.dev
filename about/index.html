        Eduardo "flootah" Saenz<br>
        most people call me Ed, or floot<br>
        <br>
        <h3>a bio:</h3>
<span class="newlines">i eeked out a computer science degree (somehow)
and now i write code for an oil company to keep the lights on.
i play videogames and videoedit and (sometimes) draw 
and think about how i should improve myself in my free time.

</span>
        <h3>an expression:</h3>
<span class="newlines">this one is a person
on their twenty-sixth version
improvements to the spine, the soul, and the skin
still acting as if nothing lies within

they wrote in volition, and dreams, and empathy, and love
they kept their mistakes, and the darkness thereof
even with cowardice, resentment, carelessness, and hate
we're still not sure what they really contemplate

some things never change
even when nothing's ever finished
it's possible we'll get there_
if they had their all in it

this website is up to keep them alive
the art that they like keeps darkness deprived
and music they play to keep them sincere
helps them to remember the things they hold dear

</span>
        <h3>a word:</h3>
        i think art is a very special thing; illustrations, games, music, the whole lot.<br>
        the people that create and ponder and judge and reimagine it are special too.<br>
        i hope to create something special, someday.<br>
        <br>
