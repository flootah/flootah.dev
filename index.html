        and welcome. to my internet space.<br>
        <br>
        i've made this little place here, to put all of my things.<br>
        things i've built and things i've thought and things.. i did!<br>
        /things/ like that.<br>
        i hope you enjoy browsing a bit.<br>

        <h3>changelog:</h3>
        * 8.20.2025<br>
        i fixed some stuff for firefox and the poems.. there's a new poem... and maybe there'll be a new start soon......<br>
        <br>

        * 2.24.2025<br>
        wow look i came back!! and revamped projects into "creations"!! and i have ideas for /more/ things??<br>
        it's hoenstly unheard of.<br>
        <br>

        * 2.22.2025<br>
        haha wow at least it's not been /that/ long...<br>
        "we're back!", as they say. and this time i've made it yellow in here and revamped my about page.<br>
        i really do want to fix my poetry page so it's more front-and-center.<br>
        but. raw html/css take so much time (read: love and care)!!!<br>
        i'll really get to it soon. kinda thought about a full revamp of this place but i like it too much.<br>
        the color change is enough.
        <br>
        <br>
        * 6.18.2024<br>
        ah.. it's been a while.. again..<br>
        i'm back, mostly just to dust off the cobwebs and make the writing around here more current.
        tick up my age in the about section, edit the bio a bit.. little things.<br>
        i also need to update the poetry list.. it deserves a full header section, methinks<br>
        for next time. i'll definitely update sooner than 18 months from now, though. (maybe.)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        * 1.16.2023<br>
        new things:<br>
        - more poetry, find it at the top of the list.<br>
        - new recs! now reflecting my new-er tastes.<br>
        -- recs also now all have links, so you can find what i'm talking about
